# Known Limitations

_As of 2026-11-04, after Phase 1._

## Architecture
- **Single device, single browser.** All data lives in `localStorage`, unencrypted. Clearing site data deletes it. There are no accounts, no sync and no server backup.
- **No real server-side ledger or authentication.** The user id is a constant (`local-user`).
- **The app lock is a privacy screen.** Anyone with access to the browser profile or dev tools can read the data.
- **Rate limits and webhook replay protection are in-memory, per instance.** On Vercel each warm instance has its own counters. Move both to Redis (e.g. Upstash) before a public launch.
- **The webhook verifies events but stores nothing.** There's no ingestion and no idempotent ledger write yet.
- `tsconfig.json` is not `strict`. Turning it on will surface more latent bugs; that's planned work for the next phase.

## Money
- Amounts are stored as exact-paise rupee numbers, not integer fields (see DECISIONS D1).
- No UI yet to create `transfer` or `refund` entries manually, or to link a refund to its original expense.
- Deleting a transaction removes it from storage. There's no soft-delete or audit trail yet.
- A group expense paid by the user is also logged as a personal expense of the **full** amount, not the user's share.
- Group budget defaults to ₹25,000 when left empty.
- The daily summary's 30-day average divides by 30 even for users with less history.

## Product and UX
- Invalid amounts in some forms (group expense, cash, subscriptions, goals) are refused without an inline error message.
- The 10 PM reminder still relies on an open browser tab (`setInterval`). It needs a server scheduler plus push.
- "Payment sync" is a simulated demo. No bank, UPI app or Account Aggregator is connected.
- The landing page and the sample data mention integrations that don't exist; marketing copy still needs a full honesty review.
- The 990 kB JavaScript bundle has no code-splitting.

## Unverified
- Behaviour of the new `api/` wrappers on Vercel, especially raw-body reading for the webhook.
- Availability and pricing of the Gemini model name `gemini-3.7-flash`.
- Legal and compliance review (DPDP, RBI/NPCI) hasn't happened. The app makes no compliance claims.
